# Introduction_to_programming_MIT_6.0001
This is my implementation of the Assigments given in the MIT First year introduction to programming course (6.0001 and 6.0002) by Professor Ann Bell, John Guttag and Eric Grimson.

### Description
The course and the projects are in python and cover the foundamentals of programming with some important statistics concept.

There is a total of 10 Exercises listed below.


| Problem Set      | Concep
